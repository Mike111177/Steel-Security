/**
 * @Class: SSCmdExe
 * @Purpose: This is an abstract class used as a superclass to all command executors.
 * @Usage: none. Extend any command executor as this, and youre good to go.
 * @Implements: CommandExecutor: utilizes the command executor for onCommand.
 * @onCommand: onCommand will be the super method for handling events. It will have a try/catch block surrounding the subclass method "handleCommand()"
 * @Events: each event will be declared and ran in its own subclass. It is up to us as the developers to remember to run our try/catch blocks.
 * @Catching: exceptions will be caught in events by calling and passing the exception into the "catchListenerException(Exception)" method.
